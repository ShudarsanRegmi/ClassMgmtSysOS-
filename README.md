## Overview

The **Class Management System (CMS)** is a comprehensive web platform designed to streamline classroom operations and communication. It offers a multi-role environment for students, class representatives (CRs), class administrators (CAs), and system administrators to manage notices, attendance, materials, voting, and more.

Built with a powerful tech stack ‚Äî **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **React.js** ‚Äî the CMS ensures a dynamic and responsive user experience. It also supports offline capabilities through **Progressive Web App (PWA)** implementation and is built with scalability and modularity in mind.

## üßæ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

* Node.js & npm
* MongoDB
* Git

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   https://github.com/ShudarsanRegmi/ClassMgmtSysOS-.git
   cd ClassMgmtSysOS-
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd backend-classmgmt
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd frontend-classmgmt
   npm install
   ```

4. **Environment setup**
   Create a `.env` file in both backend and frontend directories with necessary credentials (MongoDB URI, firebase api keys, etc.).

**Backend .env**
```
PORT=3001
MONGO_URI=mongodburl | use this (mongodb://mongo:27017/) url for docker setup
CLOUD_NAME=cloudname
CLOUD_API_KEY=cloud_api_key
CLOUD_API_SECRET=cloud_secret
```

**Firebase ServiceAccountKey.md**

Create `serviceAccountKey.json` at the root of `backend-classmgmt`

```
{
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "classmgmt-xxxx",
    "private_key_id": "6284ed185a40xxxxxxxxe82b0d381207686012",
    "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIx0jYRJAxxxxxxxxCSjhYS9BS+N/d5C1qC\nGplfQMlp1iZt/zXmXyM0Ir/8ERq97AIorU2T5lYIZs7tnhKvpQDwK8NDARrHPkfz\nCrg88exLqgwKgJCewYMMTBfwVsOUPJYfPodAlMmqB/tiTfB/lv/2/BhSv/BBdofi\n0FP3uKSQFFjcGak75Hk/JQ==\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
    "client_email": "firebase-axxxxx-fbsvc@cxxxx7d.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    "client_id": "xxxxxxxx",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc%40classmgmt-aa87d.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
  }
  

```

**Frontend .env**

```
FIREBASE_API_KEY=firebase_api_key
BASE_URL=localhost:5173
VITE_APP_ENV=development
```

5. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   cd frontend-classmgmt
   npm run dev

   # Frontend
   cd frontend-classmgmt
   npm run dev
   ```
6. **Run the app using docker engine**
   - Install the docker desktop
   - Open the docker desktop (so that docker engine will run)
   - After setting up the env files of both (frontend and backen)
   - Run the command below and see the containers in the docker containers section
   - View localhost:3000 for frontend results

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
